Welcome to my website!
Guitar is my main instrument, but I double on "things with strings" (electric bass, mandolin, ukulele, violin, ...) I also sing lead and harmonies.
I'm a versatile player, comfortable with a wide range of styles and sounds, including  
jazz, R&amp;B, funk, blues, rock, country and bluegrass. 
I'm also a prolific composer of instrumental jazz/funk tunes.
<br><br>
I've been playing professionally most of my life. Growing up in rural Connecticut,
I began playing the violin at age 8, picked up the guitar at age 13, and
developed my chops playing in bands throughout New England.
After several years on the New York City club scene, I moved to Los Angeles, 
where I attended <a href="http://www.mi.edu" target="_blank">Musicians Institute</a>. 
I graduated from Musicians Institute with honors, then worked
around Los Angeles as a studio musician and recording engineer. 
In 1990, I moved to Boulder, Colorado, where I live now.</span>
<br><br>
For my first couple of decades in Colorado, I was a busy freelancer for singer-songwriters and cover bands. Then I discovered the joys (and hassles) of being a band leader.
<br><br>
For 5 years (2012-2017), I was co-leader of <a href="http://www.purplesquirrelmusic.com" target="_blank">Purple Squirrel</a>, an innovative jazz/funk quartet. I composed a boatload of original tunes during this period. We did about 200 shows, mostly clubs and festivals in the Denver/Boulder area. And we self-published one groovy CD, "Split Shot", which you can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/split-shot-ep/id569176002" target="_blank">find on iTunes</a>.
<br><br>
My main project these days is <a href="http://www.rabblefishmusic.com" target="_blank">Rabblefish</a>. It features my original jazz/funk compositions, and a rotating lineup of Colorado's finest musicians.
